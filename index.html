   <h2><em>The Clockmaker’s Secret</em></h2>
 
   <div class="passage">
     <p>In the heart of the crooked town of Eldergate, where chimneys leaned like tired men and cobbled streets echoed with forgotten stories, stood a peculiar little shop. It was called <em>Tock & Trinket</em>, and it sold nothing but clocks—grandfather clocks, cuckoo clocks, pocket watches, and strange devices that ticked in ways no one quite understood.</p>
 
     <p>The shop’s owner, Mr. Thimblewick, was an elderly man with spectacles so thick they magnified his eyes to the size of marbles. He was always seen tinkering with gears and springs, murmuring to himself about "the precision of time." But there was a rumour, passed from child to child like a precious secret, that Mr. Thimblewick owned a clock that could turn back time—but only for a single minute.</p>
 
     <p>One rainy afternoon, curious eleven-year-old Elsie Tipton dared to enter <em>Tock & Trinket</em>. The door creaked like a groaning ghost, and the scent of brass, dust, and something unnameably ancient curled in the air. "What are you looking for, young lady?" came a voice that seemed to echo from the very walls.</p>
 
     <p>“I’m just browsing,” Elsie said bravely, her eyes wide with wonder.</p>
 
     <p>“Be careful what you wish to change,” the voice warned. “Some moments are meant to remain unchanged.”</p>
